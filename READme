# Carers GLMM Methylation Analysis  
Susan C. Anderson  
2026-02-11  

This repository contains the analysis workflow and results for a site-specific beta regression GLMM examining the effect of cooperative care (2 carers vs 3+ carers) on DNA methylation in chestnut-crowned babbler fledglings.

The model tested:

perc_meth ~ carers + xfoster + age + (1 | natal_group)

Primary focus of downstream analyses is the **carers3+ term only**.

## Analysis Steps

1. Methylation filtering pipeline
   - ≥10× coverage
   - Remove 99.9% per-sample coverage outliers
   - ≥60% site presence per carers group
   - Remove lowest 10% variance sites

2. Site-specific GLMM (beta regression, logit link)

3. FDR correction
   - By-term BH correction
   - Significance threshold: FDR ≤ 0.01

4. Effect size filtering
   - Absolute methylation change ≥ 25%

5. CpG annotation
   - Nearest TSS
   - Genomic feature classification

6. DMR identification (DMRFF)
   - Carers3+ term only
   - CpGs within 2000 bp merged
   - n ≥ 3 CpGs per DMR
   - FDR < 0.05

## Data Availability

Raw methylation matrices and large intermediate files are not included due to file size constraints. These are available upon request.

---

## Reproducibility

All analyses were conducted in R using:

- data.table
- glmmTMB
- GenomicRanges
- GenomicFeatures
- dmrff
- tidyverse packages

Full reproducibility requires access to the filtered methylation dataset and genome annotation (GCA_013400735.1).
