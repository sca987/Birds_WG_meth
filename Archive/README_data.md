Chestnut-Crowned Babbler Methylation Analysis on the Lawrence Supercomputer

This repository contains the R scripts and documentation for filtering and modeling DNA methylation data in chestnut-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus ruficeps) fledglings.

The pipeline processes site-level methylation calls into a final, model-ready dataset, runs per-site beta regressions using GLMMs, and identifies significant CpG sites based on false discovery rate (FDR) and effect size (Δ% ≥ 25) thresholds.

All analyses were done on the Lawrence Supercomputer using a high-memory (himem) node.

The files for the models are too large to store here. Please email me at susan.c.anderson@coyotes.usd.edu for full data.
