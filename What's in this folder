# What’s in This Folder

This folder contains the complete analysis workflow and final results for the carers (2 vs 3+) methylation GLMM analysis in chestnut-crowned babbler fledglings.

The analysis focuses on identifying CpG sites and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with cooperative care group (2 carers vs 3+ carers), using site-specific beta regression models.

## Full_code

This file contains the complete end-to-end analysis pipeline, including:

- Methylation data filtering
  - ≥10× coverage threshold
  - Removal of 99.9th percentile per-sample coverage outliers
  - ≥60% site presence per carers group
  - Removal of lowest 10% variance sites

- Site-specific beta regression GLMM:
  
  perc_meth ~ carers + xfoster + age + (1 | natal_group)

- By-term Benjamini–Hochberg FDR correction
- Calculation of predicted methylation differences (Δ%)
- Filtering of significant CpGs:
  - FDR ≤ 0.01
  - Absolute methylation difference ≥ 25%
- Genomic annotation of significant CpGs
- DMR identification using DMRFF (carers3+ term only)

This script fully reproduces the results in this folder when run with the appropriate input data.

## glmm_beta_significant_sites_CARERS_bytermFDR01_25pp.csv

Final filtered significant CpG sites representing the carers3+ effect only.

Inclusion criteria:
- By-term FDR ≤ 0.01
- Absolute methylation change ≥ 25%

Each row corresponds to one CpG site meeting these thresholds.

## glmm_results_beta_all_carers_xfoster_age.csv

Full per-site GLMM output for all model terms:
- (Intercept)
- carers3+
- xfoster
- age

This file contains the raw coefficient estimates, standard errors, test statistics, and p-values prior to final filtering.

Features include:
- TSS
- promoter
- 5′UTR
- 3′UTR
- gene body
- upstream10k
- downstream10k

---

## significant_fledge_sites_TSS_annotated

Significant CpGs annotated with:
- Nearest gene
- Signed distance to transcription start site (TSS)
- Direction (upstream, downstream, at_TSS)

## Notes

Raw methylation matrices and large intermediate files are not included in this folder due to file size constraints.

All results were generated using R packages including:
- data.table
- glmmTMB
- GenomicRanges
- GenomicFeatures
- dmrff
- tidyverse

The analysis was conducted using the NCBI genome assembly GCA_013400735.1.
